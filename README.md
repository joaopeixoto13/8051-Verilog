### Brief Overview

This version of 8051 ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is composed by 28 instructions:
  - 9 Arithmetic instructions
  - 9 Logic instructions
  - 5 Data transfer instructions
  - 5 jump instructions

Also, this version has:
  - 1 Timer with four modes:
    - MODE 1: 13bits timer/counter
    - MODE 2: 16bits timer/counter
    - MODE 3: 8 bits timer/counter with Autoreload
    - MODE 4: Same as above but with same differences
  - SPI Slave interface
  - UART
  - 4 Interrupts 
      - Triggered by Timer when overflow
      - Triggered by an external event
      - Triggered by a reception of UART
      - Triggered by a transmission of UART
